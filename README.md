***Note***: The vast majority of this project was developed using A&M's internal github. However, we realized that it did not have the ability to render ipython notebooks in its code viewer. We switched to the standard github website so that people could read our notebooks without having to download them. (This is why this repository shows a low number of commits.) You can visit our original repository at [this link](https://github.tamu.edu/sagar794/RecipeRescuer).
